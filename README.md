# Sentinel Link

</div>

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> This does require you to be linked with the Discord bot prior to using this as you will not be able to generate an API key.

Head on over to [releases](https://github.com/nobaboy/SentinelLink/releases) and download the latest available version.

To link your account, use `/sentinel key <key>` and replace `<key>` with the API key you obtained from the Discord bot.

To unlink your account, use `/sentinel unlink`, which would unlink the account your currently on from the mod (pay attention, I said the mod not the Discord bot).

To completely reset your config (as in erase all the tokens you have), use `/sentinel reset`.

Once configured, the mod will automatically acknowledge your login, meaning the Discord bot will not require you to acknowledge it.
